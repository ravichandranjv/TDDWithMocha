# TDDWithMocha
Test Driven Development using Mocha.

Pre-requisites - NodeJs - https://nodejs.org, Mocha - npm install mocha --save-dev

Please refer to the presentation file(s) "TDDWithMocha" in PDF and in PPTX format for a deep dive into TDD with BDD.

This is the BDD + TDD part, in continuation to BDD With SlimJs - https://github.com/ravichandranjv/BDDWithSlimJS

I will update the link here for the UADD part of BDD + TDD + UADD as soon as the artefacts are ready to be pushed.
